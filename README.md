# MCP File Edit

A simple Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive file system operations including the ability to patch files and perform basic code analysis aimed at reducing Claude Desktop's token usage when compared to other similar tools. Built on FastMCP.

## Features

- üìÅ **File Operations**: Read, write, create, delete, move, and copy files
- üìÇ **Directory Management**: List files, create directories, recursive operations  
- üîç **Search**: Search for patterns in files using regex with depth control
- üîÑ **Replace**: Find and replace text across multiple files
- üîß **Patch**: Apply precise modifications using line, pattern, or context-based patches
- üìç **Project Directory**: Set a working directory for simplified relative paths
- üß¨ **Code Analysis**: Extract functions, classes, and structure from code files
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety**: Built-in path traversal protection and safe operations- üíæ **Binary Support**: Handle both text and binary files with proper encoding

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrickomatik/mcp-file-edit.git
cd mcp-file-edit
uv pip install -e .
```

### Using pip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrickomatik/mcp-file-edit.git
cd mcp-file-edit
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "file-edit": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp", "run", "/path/to/mcp-file-edit/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or with Python directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "file-edit": {
      "command": "/path/to/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-file-edit/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Restart Claude Desktop

After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

## Usage Guide

### Project Directory (Recommended)

Always set a project directory first to use relative paths:

```python
# Set project directory
set_project_directory("/path/to/your/project")

# Now use simple relative paths
read_file("src/main.py")              # Reads from project/src/main.py
write_file("docs/README.md", content) # Writes to project/docs/README.md
list_files("tests")                   # Lists files in project/tests
```

### Basic File Operations

```python
# Read a file
content = read_file("example.txt")

# Write a file
write_file("output.txt", "Hello, World!")

# Create a new file
create_file("new_file.py", "# New Python file")

# Delete a file
delete_file("old_file.txt")

# Move/rename a file
move_file("old_name.txt", "new_name.txt")

# Copy a file
copy_file("source.txt", "destination.txt")
```

### Search and Replace

```python
# Search for patterns
results = search_files(
    pattern="TODO|FIXME",
    path="src",
    recursive=True,
    max_depth=3
)

# Replace across files
replace_in_files(
    search="old_function",
    replace="new_function",
    path=".",
    file_pattern="*.py"
)
```

### Advanced Patching

```python
# Line-based patch
patch_file("config.json", patches=[
    {"line": 5, "content": '    "debug": true,'}
])

# Pattern-based patch
patch_file("main.py", patches=[
    {"find": "import old", "replace": "import new"}
])

# Context-based patch (safer)
patch_file("app.py", patches=[{
    "context": ["def process():", "    return None"],
    "replace": ["def process():", "    return result"]
}])
```

### Code Analysis

```python
# List all functions in a file
functions = list_functions("mycode.py")
# Returns function names, signatures, line numbers, docstrings

# Find function at specific line
func = get_function_at_line("mycode.py", 42)
# Returns the function containing line 42

# Get complete code structure
structure = get_code_structure("mycode.py")
# Returns imports, classes, functions, and more

# Search for functions by pattern
results = search_functions("test_.*", "tests/", "*.py")
# Finds all test functions

## Available Tools

### File Operations
- `read_file` - Read file contents with optional line range
- `write_file` - Write content to a file  
- `create_file` - Create a new file
- `delete_file` - Delete a file or directory
- `move_file` - Move or rename files
- `copy_file` - Copy files or directories

### Directory Operations
- `list_files` - List files with glob patterns and depth control
- `get_file_info` - Get detailed file metadata

### Search and Modification
- `search_files` - Search for patterns with regex support
- `replace_in_files` - Find and replace across multiple files
- `patch_file` - Apply precise modifications to files

### Project Management
- `set_project_directory` - Set the working directory context
- `get_project_directory` - Get current project directory
### Code Analysis- `list_functions` - List all functions in a code file with signatures and line numbers- `get_function_at_line` - Find which function contains a specific line- `get_code_structure` - Extract complete code structure (imports, classes, functions)- `search_functions` - Search for functions by name pattern across files
## Safety Features

- **Path Traversal Protection**: All paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Project Boundary Enforcement**: Operations are restricted to the base directory
- **Backup Creation**: Automatic backups before modifications (configurable)
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes before applying them
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing patch applications

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for detailed usage examples:
- `example_usage.py` - Basic file operations
- `enhanced_features_examples.py` - Advanced search and depth control
- `patch_examples.py` - Various patching techniques
